**!! NOTE !!**
The uiCore library is still in development and will be updated on a regular base. At this point multiple features to access the core components are missing and will be implemented soon.

The **uiCore** is a library meant to be used with **Qt**.

This library takes away the effort to create and manage the fundamental objects for a technical user interface (UI).

To create the user inteface no widget creation is required. The API provides all common objects, but also allowes external QWidgets to be displayed.

Features:
  - **Skriptable UI** - The UI will be created from code by using the API that provides the functions to modify the UI.
  - **Cross-plattform** - The uiCore depends only on **Qt** and the **TabToolbar** library.
  - **Configurable** - The uiCore can be used and configured with ease.
  - **Microservice ready** - Object creation can be performed by using only base data types. Event notification is handled with messages that are send via the uiCore message system.
  - **Fast and easy creation** - When creating a new application and the efford for creating the whole UI wants to be skipped, this is the perfect solution.

**Create an application based on on the uiCore with VisualStudio**

-------------

**Requirements**

1) Qt must be installed
2) Create an Environment variable (System settings or batch file) for the %QTDIR%,
	which should result in something like this: ...\Qt\5.11.2\msvc2017_64
3) Install the Qt VS Tool Add-on for Visual Studio
4) In the Qt VS Tool options add a new Qt Version with the name: $(QTDIR)
	This will disable the path selection and read the path from the environment variable.

-------------

**Project settings**

1) Create a new Qt Widgets Application (Core, Gui and Widgets must be selected in the dialog)
2) Create an Evironment variable (System Settings or batch file) for the %UICORE_LIB_ROOT%
3) Configuration Properties (For a x64 build):
	Add:		VC++ Directories->Include Directories:				$(ProjectDir)include;
	Ensure:		C/C++->General->Additional Include Directories contains:	$(Qt_INCLUDEPATH_);
	Add:		C/C++->General->Additional Include Directories:			%UI_CORE_ROOT%\include;
	Ensure:		Linker->General->Additional Library Directories contains:	$(Qt_LIBPATH_);
	Add <Debug>:	Linker->General->Additional Library Directories:		%UI_CORE_ROOT%\x64\Debug;
	Add <Release>:	Linker->General->Additional Library Directories:		%UI_CORE_ROOT%\x64\Release;
	Ensure:		Linker->Input->Additional Dependencies contains:		$(Qt_LIBS_);
	Add <Debug>:	Linker->Input->Additional Dependencies:				%UI_CORE_ROOT%\x64\Debug\uiCore.lib;
	Add <Release>:	Linker->Input->Additional Dependencies:				%UI_CORE_ROOT%\x64\Release\uiCore.lib;
	Set <Debug>:	Debugging->Environment:						PATH=$(QtDllPath);%UI_CORE_ROOT%\x64\Debug;%UI_CORE_ROOT%\Third_Party_Libraries\QtTabToolbar\DLL; ...<other paths>... ;%PATH%
	Set <Release>:	Debugging->Environment:						PATH=$(QtDllPath);%UI_CORE_ROOT%\x64\Release;%UI_CORE_ROOT%\Third_Party_Libraries\QtTabToolbar\DLL; ...<other paths>... ;%PATH%

-------------

**Configuration Properties for all Qt Application (fixes a bug for executing in VS2017)**

	Add:		Custom Build Step->General->CommandLine:			copy $(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\qt.conf $(OutputPath)
	Add:		Custom Build Step->General->Outputs:				$(OutputPath)\qt.conf
	Select:		Custom Build Step->General->Execute After:			ClCompile
	Select:		Custom Build Step->General->Execute Before:			Link
This will create a "qt.conf" file which will be placed in the output directory.
This file must be in the same directory as the executable.
